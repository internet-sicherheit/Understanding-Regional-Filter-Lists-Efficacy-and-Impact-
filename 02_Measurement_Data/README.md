# Measurement data

## BigQuery

Currently, we provide a link to the [Big Query dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=filterlists&inv=1&invt=Abj0cQ&ws=!1m0)
because it is easier for the reviewer to access the data. In the future, we will provide
the data as gzip-files over a cloud hosting service.
