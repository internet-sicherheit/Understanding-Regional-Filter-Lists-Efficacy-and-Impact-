# Measurement data

## BigQuery

The data from BigQuery tables cookies, requests, and responses are now available in the [Sciebo](https://w-hs.sciebo.de/s/su7B11bXII1a1A4) folder. The tables are stored in multiple JSON files and compressed as zip files. Please note that working with those data needs changes in all scripts since no SQL queries are necessary. By using other databases (e.g. PostgreSQL) changes in the query structure are needed.

The data can also be found on a [Sciebo](https://w-hs.sciebo.de/s/su7B11bXII1a1A4) folder as part of the backup.
